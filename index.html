    <h1 class="headings" id="about">WHAT IS IDENTITY V?</h1>
    <p class="paragraphs">
        'Identity V' is an asymmetrical 1v4 game developed by the company 'Netease' in July 2018.<br />
        It is a free to play mobile game that has a PC version available.<br />
        The game style is very Tim Burton/Coraline-esque, as the characters have a doll-like appearance. This is what got me into the game.<br />
        The gameplay is very similar to 'Dead by Daylight', where four Survivors go up against one Hunter. Suruvivors have to escape and the Hunter has to stop them.<br />
        New players assume the role of Orpheus, a detective tasked with resolving a missing persons case, who was sent a letter to find a missing girl.<br />
        The player ends up in a strange manor, finding abandoned diaries that describe a horrifying game once held in the manor<br />
